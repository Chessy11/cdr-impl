Your front-drive car has excellent all-season tires and ABS (antilock braking system)\u2014although the ABS light has been on since you banzai&#8217;d the berm at the end of the driveway an hour ago. This may explain the loss of steering control when you&#8217;re slowing down for a corner. Like this downhill turn, right &#8230; there, as you blow straight past it with the wheels skidding and the steering cranked over hard against the stop.<\/p>\n<p class=\"quote-simple\">ABS has become pretty much standard equipment on most vehicles. Sensors tell a computer when a wheel stops rotating, which indicates\u2014at least when the vehicle still has forward speed\u2014that the brakes have overpowered the available traction at that particular wheel. The computer then directs a hydraulic valve to release some brake fluid pressure to the wheel to let it rotate again.<\/p>\n<p>This process repeats many times per second until the vehicle stops or you lift your foot off the brake pedal. The ABS computer does a power-on self test every time you cycle the ignition. If it finds it&#8217;s lacking data, or a hydraulic pump or valve isn&#8217;t responding, it illuminates the ABS warning light on the dash.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the river and through the woods was more dangerous back when cars had crummy bias-ply tires, rear-wheel drive and ordinary brakes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":711,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[30],"tags":[38,37],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/659"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=659"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/659\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/711"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=659"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=659"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/smartdemowp.com\/solustrid\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=659"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
